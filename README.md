# qml-rounded-shadow-framelesswindow
Rounded corner, shadow-bordered frameless window made out of qml, execute with PyQt5

This is the project for my personal QML practicing, so far, at least.

Of course you can look these whole things up for the sake of your practice as well.

## Requirements
* PyQt5 >= 5.8

## Setup
`python -m pip install git+https://github.com/yjg30737/qml-rounded-shadow-framelesswindow.git --upgrade`

## Example
```python
from qml_rounded_shadow_framelesswindow.main import showQml

showQml()
```

Result
